// Regular Expressions: Use Capture Groups to Search and Replace

// Write a regex so that it will search for the string "good". Then update the
// replaceText variable to replace "good" with "okey-dokey".

let huhText = "This sandwich is good.";
let fixRegex = /good/; // Change this line
let replaceText = "okey-dokey"; // Change this line
let result = huhText.replace(fixRegex, replaceText);
