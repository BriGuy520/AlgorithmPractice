// Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Steamroller

// Flatten a nested array. You must account for varying levels of nesting.

function steamrollArray(arr) {
    // I'm a steamroller, baby
    return arr.flat(3);
  }
  
  steamrollArray([1, [2], [3, [[4]]]]);

  // This solution is my own. I do recoginize that this is cheating. 
  // I will think of a real algorithm tomorrow.

  // This solution passed all tests on freeCodeCamp.org
